## Idea:

Version controlling Publisher and Integrator Resolve Python library for any project manager platform (PMP)

## Brief details:

Inspiration is taken partly from NukeStudio basic concept of Clip Exporter. This python library is about to connect any project manager platform (Ftrack, Shotgun, Avalon, Pyblish) into Resolve. It is also independent on any of them so it could be easily plugged. As we are working with color correcting editorial system we could also develop the way any simple Primary grading could be converted to correct lut and extracted as pre-look (including looks from on-set-grading with additional stabilisations) and therefore let artists to preview raw data with the same look as in color-grading page in Resolve.

## Vocabulary:

-   Context
-   Clip
-   Asset
-   Subset
-   Representation
-   Loader
-   Integrator
-   Extractor

## Key features:

-   Publishing context as json data object
    -   Exporting to a json file
    -   Extracting to linked PMP api
-   Renaming clips with template in sequence or single with additional hierarchy
-   Integrating schema validated data back to timeline (clips, subsets with specified representations)

## UI concept:

Adding timeline context menu items: Publish, VersionUp, VersionDown, VersionMax, VersionMin, Rename; so we could easily operate the library from the Resolveâ€™s context.

Dialogue window for Rename will let a user add hierarchical context to a clip for easy distribution into asset database with parenting. Template for name syntax can be evaluated from preset json file or from gui input field, this can be controlled with a selector.

## Key components:

-   Python 3.6 >
-   OpenTimelineIO
-   OpenColorIO
-   Clique
-   PathLib
-   Json

## Key classes:

-   Context:

    -   Load Collectors: CollectSceneData, CollectSelectedClipsData, CollectLookData
    -   Load Extractors: ExtractJson2File, Extract2Ftrack, Extract2Shotgun, Extract2AvalonDB, Extract2Pyblish
    -   Load Integrators: IntegrateClip2Timeline, IntegrateSubsets2Timeline
